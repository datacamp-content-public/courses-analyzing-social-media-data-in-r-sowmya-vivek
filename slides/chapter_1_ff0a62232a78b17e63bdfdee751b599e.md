Now that we have a DTM and simple Word Cloud and frequency plots to visualize the most frequent words, we will proceed to more advanced visualizations to understand words that frequently combine together.

`@part1`
- Cluster Dendrograms are useful for visualizing Word clusters {{1}}
- Word clustering identifies word groups occurring together {{2}}
- Based on word distances {{3}}
- Groups words into related clusters {{4}}
- Dimension reduction technique {{5}}

## Coding Cluster Dendrograms

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "990a34c47b"
```

`@part1`
```
library(tm) 
#Treat DTM for sparse terms
dtm2 <- removeSparseTerms(dtm, sparse = 0.9)

#Build hierarchical cluster
hc <- hclust(d = dist(dtm2, method = "euclidean"), method = "complete")

#Plot cluster dendrogram
plot(hc)
```
