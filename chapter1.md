## Time Series Plots

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 7a53b4247e
xp: 100
```

Time series data is used to analyze how data changes over time. Visualizing time series of tweets gives useful insights about how the number of tweets vary over time.

In this exercise, you will visualize how the following vary over different time intervals:
	1. Tweets by a famous personality (Rihanna) - rih_tweet
	2. Tweets on a specific topic (Artificial Intelligence) - AI_tweet

The library "rtweet" and datasets containing extracted tweets for the two use cases have been pre-loaded.

For Rihanna, you will create a dataframe containing frequency of tweets over time using ts_data function.
You will then plot the time series using ts_plot function, setting the intervals to monthly.

Finally, you will plot the time series for AI using ts_plot and for hourly intervals.

`@instructions`
- Convert 'rih_tweet' into a time series data object using `ts_data` function.
- Create a Time Series plot using `ts_plot` function with interval set to `"months"`. 
- Create a Time Series plot for 'AI_tweet' using `ts_plot` with `"hours"` as time interval.

`@hint`
- Use `ts_data` to convert tweet data to a time series like data object.
- Use `ts_plot` to create the Time Series plots.
- The argument for time interval `"months"` or `"hours"` should be inside double quotes as shown here.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
# Load the library rtweet
library(rtweet)

# Load dataset with tweets on "Artificial Intelligence"
AI_tweet = readRDS("AI_api.rds")
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# Load dataset containing Rihanna's tweets
rih_tweet = readRDS("rihanna_namesearch.rds")

# Convert tweets data into time series-like data object
_______(rih_tweet)

# Plot tweets data over time - monthly
_______(rih_tweet, _______, col="blue")

# Plot tweets data over time - hourly
_______(AI_tweet, _______, col="red")
```

`@solution`
```{r}
# Load dataset containing Rihanna's tweets
rih_tweet = readRDS("rihanna_namesearch.rds")

# Convert tweets data into time series-like data object
ts_data(rih_tweet)

# Plot tweets data over time - monthly
ts_plot(rih_tweet, "months", col="blue")

# Plot tweets data over time - hourly
ts_plot(AI_tweet, "hours", col="red")
```
